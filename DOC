Outline of steps used to complete CVDO.

1. Preformed steps layed out in README file.

2. Transfered CVDO.obo file to local machine to work on OBO-Edit.
   - Started by using reasoner to remove any redundant links in ontology.
   - Check each "name:" of ontology, because some of the wording was void of usable 
     pattern matching for clean up steps. i.e. word order.
   - Review the obo file and found and additional 11 word that were missed clean up steps. 

3. Next, made two scripts which take terms from fma.obo and PATO.obo and match them to CVDO.obo (Name_Matcher.pl & Common_Matcher.pl).

4. Used anatomy terms from fma.obo (PATO.obo had zero matches), to create a list of anatomy terms. Used this list to clean up nodes 
   with two or more is_a parents (based on the EQ model use by Mungall et al.).

5. Many CVDO terms were deleted, but none were added.  Rough outline of each step is noted in ../data/Term_Clean_up.txt file.

6. Wrote script to add Gene variant file, to CVDO. Because of timing of addition, was only able to add ~80% computationally, 
   added the remaining manually. (this step has been taken care of now).

7. Used the symptom ontology to clean-up/add proper is_a relationships.  This was used manually via "import terms" in OBO-Edit.

8. Added Harrison's definition to each term manually.

9. Further cleaned up relationships using OBOB.

10. Added SNOMED to every term possable.

11. Created Harrison's ontology.

12. Added HGNC term to each gene if available.
